# React Community Tools and Practices Cheatsheet

This is a placeholder for an idea:

> it feels like there maybe needs to be more of a community effort to build up some kind of a centralized "best practices" site, perhaps similar to the React+TS CheatSheet ( https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react )
> what if the community collaborated on putting together a centralized list of what the major options are in different categories, and when it might make sense to use them?  
> Obviously this could easily devolve into "NO, YOU SHOULD BE USING TOOL X INSTEAD OF TOOL Y", or "WHY ISN'T MY LIB WITH 27 STARS LISTED?".  There'd need to be both curation and friendly cooperation from experts within the community in this.
> Example, state management. The main options by usage % are plain React state, Redux, MobX, XState. Those overlap with data fetching libs like Apollo, React Query, and SWR. What if each lib submitted a page saying "here's our tool, what it solves, and when you might use it"  
> Similarly, styling. Major options are inline styles, plain CSS, CSS Modules, and CSS-in-JS approaches. Have some pages that detail what those options are, pros/cons, and why you might consider each approach. Not flat-out saying "use X or Y". Just "here's options and use cases"
> One more: how do you pick between CRA, Next, Gatsby, or something like a Snowpack or Vite, to build a React app? When does it make sense to use any of those? Having a list of the major options and tradeoffs involved would be valuable.  
> Stackshare and Slant are _sorta_ along the lines of what I'm describing, although I'm picturing something much more text-based and involving descriptions, examples, and use cases.
> I'm not saying any of this would be easy, and there'd be a lot of wrangling over how to format and present this info. also, not all would be "competing libs". like, `fetch` vs `axios` vs `redaxios` vs your own fetch wrapper

So, this is me sorta putting my money where my mouth is, and creating a repo to start this.  **Let's file some issues and figure out what this might look like, together!**
